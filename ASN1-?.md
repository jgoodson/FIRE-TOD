\**Note: This assignment has several associated questions you'll find as you go through this that need to be submitted on ELMS. Some of these ask you to explain or guess why certain things may be the way that they are. I am not grading on correctness here, rather I am grading based on whether you have completed the assignment and put some thought into the answers. Feel free to discuss these with your group or with me in lab. We will likely go over some of the more important material during class as well.*

**Q1) Please collect each successful command you run and submit these as answer 1. Specifically, submit the list of complete commands another student would need to run to precisely replicate the analysis you performed.**

# Submission

This assignment will be linked on ELMS and there should be a submission form for ASN5. You should submit this assignment individually. Feel free to work with and discuss the process and questions with classmates, but make please write your own answers!
